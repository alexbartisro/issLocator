issLocator
==========

Small python program that tracks the International Space Station and displays the coordinates (and an address if any)

This software requires pygeocoder for reverse geocoding (getting the address from the coordinates). You can find it at http://code.xster.net/pygeocoder/wiki/Home

Feel free to use this under GPL terms, but I'd appreciate it you hit me up at alex.bartis@gmail.com and tell me about the cool projects in which you use it.

how to use:
1. install pygeocoder
2. python issLocator.py
